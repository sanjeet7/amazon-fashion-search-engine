## Executive Summary

This comprehensive analysis of the Amazon Fashion dataset reveals a high-quality foundation for building a semantic search prototype. With an overall data quality score of 99.8% (Grade A) and strategic opportunities for hybrid search implementation, the dataset supports both semantic embeddings and structured filtering approaches.

### Key Dataset Characteristics

- **Scale**: 826K products requiring 1.32GB storage
- **Quality**: Excellent data integrity with minimal anomalies (<0.2%)
- **Coverage**: High completeness in critical fields (title: 100%, ratings: 91.6%)
- **Diversity**: 12,768 unique brands with balanced market distribution

---

## Strategic Findings

### 1. Optimal Sampling Strategy

**Recommendation**: Stratified Quality-Based Sampling (150,000 products)

- **Rationale**: Balance between cost optimization and quality representation
- **Quality Criteria**: Products with ratings, complete titles/features, brand information
- **Coverage**: 18.2% of full dataset providing comprehensive market representation
- **Benefits**: Ensures business signal availability while maintaining semantic diversity

### 2. Feature Engineering Strategy

**Recommendation**: Title + Features + Selective Details

- **Content Strategy**: Multi-layered text representation for embedding generation
- **Token Budget**: ~89 tokens per product (optimized for cost-quality balance)
- **Cost Projection**: $0.68 for full dataset embedding (text-embedding-3-small)
- **Field Priorities**:
  - **Title** (Critical): Primary semantic content and product identification
  - **Features** (High): Structured attributes and specifications
  - **Selective Details** (Medium): Fashion-relevant details, excluding operational noise

### 3. Hybrid Search Architecture

**Primary Approach**: Semantic + Structured Filtering

**Priority Filters** (by effectiveness score):
1. **Brand/Store Filter** (96.9% coverage): Excellent for marketplace and brand-specific queries
2. **Semantic Category Filter** (91.6% coverage): Product type identification (dress, shoes, etc.)
3. **Quality Tier Filter** (91.6% coverage): Customer satisfaction and product maturity signals
4. **Price Range Filter** (6.1% coverage): Budget-based filtering when available

**Inclusive Filtering Strategy**: Boost matching products rather than eliminating due to missing filter data

### 4. Business Ranking Optimization

**Multi-Signal Ranking Approach**:
- **Semantic Similarity**: Primary relevance signal (embedding cosine similarity)
- **Business Signals**: Data-driven weighting based on discriminative power
  - Average Rating (CV: 0.241 - moderate discriminative power)
  - Log(Review Count) (CV: 0.849 - high discriminative power)
- **Adaptive Weighting**: Dynamic adjustment based on signal availability and strength

### 5. Material/Color Strategy

**Hybrid Semantic-Structured Approach**:
- **Primary**: Semantic processing (67.3% color coverage in titles enables natural language matching)
- **Secondary**: Structured filters when explicitly available
- **Advantage**: Handles diverse expressions ("navy blue dress" vs "blue dress navy")
